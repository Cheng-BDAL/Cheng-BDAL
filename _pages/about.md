About Cheng Meng
======
<<<<<<< HEAD
I am an Assistant Professor in the Institute of Statistics and Big Data (ISBD), Renmin University of China. I received my PhD in Statistics from Department of Statistics at the University of Georgia in 2020. I worked in Big Data Analytics Lab (BDAL), under the joint supervision of Professor Ping Ma and Professor Wenxuan Zhong. I received a BSc degree in Mathematics from Tsinghua University in 2015.

About BDAL-RUC
======
Our lab's research interests lie in developing novel theoretically justifiable and computationally efficient methods for tackling the computation burden brought about by the sheer size of large-scale datasets. Our current research interests are as follows.

- Statistical machine learning
- Subsampling methods in big data
- Large-scale optimal transport problems
- Non/Semi-parametric modeling
- Generative models
- Statistical applications in imaging data, LiDAR data and 3d point cloud data

By leveraging advanced statistical models and computational techniques, we have successfully addressed challenges in fields such as image processing, large-scale transportation optimization, and generative modeling. Our research has direct applications in industries including healthcare, autonomous systems, and environmental monitoring. In the future, our lab aims to expand its research into new areas such as artificial intelligence, sustainable data analytics, and quantum computing, continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible with statistical methods in practice.
