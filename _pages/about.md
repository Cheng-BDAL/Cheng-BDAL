About BDAL-RUC
======
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hello everyone, I'm Cheng Meng, currently an Assistant Professor and Ph.D. advisor at the Institute of Statistics and Big Data at Renmin University of China (RUC). My primary research interests lie in big data statistics, optimal transport, artificial intelligence, and industrial statistics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I graduated from the Department of Mathematics at Tsinghua University in 2015 and earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Georgia in 2020. I was fortunate to be advised by the remarkable academic duo, Professors Ping Ma and Wenxuan Zhong, who lead the Big Data Analytics Lab (BDAL). After joining RUC, I had the pleasure of working with a talented group of students, with whom I co-founded the BDAL-RUC Lab. To date, my students have been awarded the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) Student Paper Award twice (a first for institutions in mainland China) and have received the National Scholarship on two occasions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am honored to have received the 2023 Junior Researcher Award from the International Chinese Statistical Association (one of five recipients globally) and the Huawei Spark Award for tackling key challenges, with recognition from both RUC's and Huawei's official media channels. I serve as the principal investigator for a National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Youth Fund project as well as multiple projects sponsored by Huawei. In recent years, our lab has been dedicated to developing theoretically grounded, fast algorithms for big data, aiming to advance the application of statistical methodologies across a range of industrial and interdisciplinary domains.
